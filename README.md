# aws-lambda
This project implements a set of microservices that coordinate in order to guarantee data consistency using AWS Lambda and the AWS serverless application model (SAM).

# Resources
For this project we will use AWS Lambdas to implement several microservices that will run code in response to HTTP requests (using the Amazon API Gateway) and will coordinate in order to achieve data consistency. Below we provide some useful links with more information about the AWS systems being used for this project.

# Tools
For developing microservices using lambdas AWS offers a set of command line interface tools and editor plugins that make development and deployment easier.

- [Installing the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)
- [Installing the AWS SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install-windows.html)
